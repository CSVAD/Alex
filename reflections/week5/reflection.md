## Computers as a unique medium

Although I disagree with Bret Victor about purpose of a computer in creating unique art (I believe that the generativity and complexity of computer generated art adds it own dimesion to computer art), the ability computer to be interactive makes a computer a medium distinct from other forms of art. There has always been performance art and select instatnces where the audience interacted with the artwork but, in computer art is geared toward interaction between the audience and the work of art. Bret mentions that video games as a form of art add an entirely different dimension to the work compared to just an animation or a painting; they are not alive like interactive art. I think that a visual approach to the creation of interactive art is more condusive to creating artwork. Writing code for art might create more unique art and unexpected works of art it does not allow for accurate expersion of your artistic ideas.
