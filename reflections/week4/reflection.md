## Generative art and GANs

If we take an overview of the discussion around GAN and other generative design methods like topological optimization, I think that many misrepresent and over estimate theses methods in the process of design. I think that Che-Wei Wang inflates the potential of neural networks in making judgments on fuzzy concepts such as beauty and comfort since models currently struggle to generate output based on concrete values. Maybe a GANs will never be able to generate chairs based on your preferences or maybe GAN will be the new Design galleries and will still require help from a designer to supervise the process. Although some are concerned about the emergence of GANs and other methods, I believe GAN is just another tool in generative art. The novelty and effectiveness of GAN and GAN art work is why I think some people dislike it. GAN learns to create new output based on examples given for training however, it does not simply take a probabilistic approach like other models(auto-encoders) but it understands the features of the training data and generates something new. I think that Memo Akten makes an important point about the bias of a model like GANs or pixtopix; if the model is only shown flowers, it will only create flowers. Like in Helena Sarin's work part of the artist's job is to choose what to show to the model and how to use the output of the model.
