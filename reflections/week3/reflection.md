## Design galleries and Juxtapose

Design galleries was an interesting approach to design space exploration for the time when the paper was publish because of the limitations on processing power and the cost of graphic calculations. Parameterize the possible resulting graphics given a set of input parameter and then selecting a set of possible configuration to maximally represent the design space gives the user a great ability to understand the design space. While juxtapose may be more practically in actual design work, I don't think it provides the same exploration as Design galleries since it removes the user's bias against possibly aesthetic designs. I think that Juxtapose is a much more effective and useful design tool since it does not require difficult setup and complicated parameterization of output-value vectors. On the other hand, Design galleries is difficult to use and is not as necessary because of the advance in computing power but, I feel that it provides a unique representation of the design space by it's mechanical approach to generating a set of designs.
