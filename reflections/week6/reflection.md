## Future gui design

One of the most abused features of modern computer, I believe, is the GUI. Nowadays a graphical interface is almost a requirement for any application however, many add it as an after thought creating tedious user experience. Like mentions in the paper by Michel Beaudouin-Lafon the use of WIMP(window, icon, menus, pointing) interface is not always conducive to the most effective use of a graphical interface. Dialog boxes and menus have a large degree of indirection from the user's object of interest. This not only decreases productivity but interrupts the creative flow of ideas and result in an overall result that is dissatisfactory to the user. It is not absolutely necessary to have a fully functional interface full of hotkeys and command windows since this is a poor solution for the average user. The idea of alternative programming interfaces is definitely an area worth consideration like the context free grammar for drawing but I think the limitations of the context free tool don't allow the average user to fully through a tool like that. A proper GUI will be largely intuitive maybe based on psychological principals of how humans see the world. For elements that are not intuitive and would usually be placed inside a series of dialog boxes there should be a system of hotkeys or command that the interface teaches to the user to improve their mastery of the software.
