## Line Wave Reflection

Using the plotter had several limitations that I had to overcome in the creation of my art work. Since the plotter is a physical device it is limited by the speed at which it can move, therefor very complicated works of art take a very long time to plot. There were also many physical limitations of the hardware include the thickness of the pen and the rate at with it can reliably write. The other limitations of the plotter like a lack of color, fill and line thickness variation were not an issue but a welcome domain/framework for the creation of artwork. The plotter provided a new opportunity to experiment with pens and ink. Since you are working with a physical medium there is an analog translation of your artwork to the paper which creates a certain characteristic to the lines you draw. The choice of ink also effects how the pen interacts with the paper and levels of shading when lines cross. Although there are limitations with the use of a plotter, the feel of a physical artwork provides an indescribable dimension to the art.
