## Gradient generator

Continuing from week5 and my gradient drawing tool, I decided to make a sketch that generated gradients from images to make it easier to choose aesthetic gradients. The tool is used by clicking on the image to make a swatch of the color in the image you clicked on. Now you can move the swatch by pressing 'm' and dragging the swatch with that mouse, delete this swatch by pressing z or create a gradient from this swatch to another by double clicking on one then the other. Once you have created a gradient you may also decide to create a swatch from a color on the gradient. This tool is mainly for exploration of colors within an images along with possible shades of those colors. Not only can this tool help choose a singular color, it can help to a gradient between two colors within an image. This tool is very easy to use given its simple interface and has its expressiveness only limited by the images you choose. This favorable combination is a result of gradients between the two color providing a full spectrum of possibilities.
