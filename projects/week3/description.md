##Parametric 3D From

After seeing the effect of the sine function on the vase I knew I wanted to incorporate the sine function into my design. I settled on creating a plane that changed the height of the points on the plane base on the sine function with a few degrees of freedom. While writing the code for this I made a mistake and accidentally connected quads from opposite side of the grid however, it gave an appearance which I enjoyed so I left it in there. Once I had finished adding the constraints for the sine function (frequency, amplitude, phase) and a variable for the size of the plane, I felt that there was a missing element of perspective so three other constraints were added. I choose to give the user the ability to change the angle of the plane, change the elevation of their camera and the distance to the plane. While the parameters to the sine function did affect the design positively, the addition of the ability to change the users camera position greatly improved both the possibilities for the design and the aesthetics of existing designs.
