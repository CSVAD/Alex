## Gradient draw
The inspiration for this project came form the new Firefox logo. I started with the idea that I wanted to incorporate gradient into my tool. The first iteration of the tool simply created a rectangle of a certain color from a predefined gradient file when the user pressed the mouse. Upon further consideration I add a slow rotation to the rectangle and a changing alpha value to help increase the effect of multiple layers of the drawing. I decided to intentionally lock several parameter in the tool since I found that many configurations did not produce interesting results. The final implementation of the tool has only the users mouse movement and mouse presses as an input an all the other aspects of the tool is controlled in the code and the gradient file. This tool is not only geared towards gradients since the gradient file is simple an image that the code iterates over to choose its color.
